# Project 4 - Simple Scrolling Game

With this project, you'll demonstrate your ability to do basic drawing operations in the HTML Canvas element and to use a variety of JavaScript language features.

Check the requirements and the hints, and ask questions in Piazza.

## Requirements

1. Game includes a player on the bottom that moves left/right based on arrow keys.

2. Game includes a harm character and a benefit character, each of which "falls" from the top of the game canvas.

3. One of your characters must be an image.

4. Characters reaching the bottom of the game canvas should reappear at the top of the canvas, in a random x position.

5. Collision between the player and the harm reduces the number of lives left.

6. Collision between the player and the benefit increases the score.

7. The score and the number of lives left should be displayed at the top of the game canvas.

8. When the player loses their last life, the animation stops and "Game Over" is displayed on the screen in large, red letters.


## Hints

Ask questions.

I don't expect that you know how to accomplish the result, so ask questions, early and often.
